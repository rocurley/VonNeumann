VonNeumann
==========

This is a set of computercraft scripts I'm working on, to create a Von Neumann machine in Minecraft.
It's not done yet, but so far I have:

Base Manager: A system to automatically compress cobblestone and dump excess resources.

Dark Iron: A turtle script which allow automatic crafting of dark iron.

Dependancy Tree: a graph of the materials  required for the full system.

Mining Turtle Coal/Lava: Outdated attempt at an automatic mining system.

Quarry Deployer: A working turtle script that automatically deploys quarries and sends the resourcs gathered home.
Will run until the server crashes.

Quarry FSM: An attempt to rewrite the above in a crash-resistant way. Not yet working.
